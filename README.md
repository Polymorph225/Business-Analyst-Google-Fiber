Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to develop a dashboard to analyze fictional call center data, reflecting real-world scenarios. The primary objective is to provide the customer service team with insights into repeat caller behavior to enable proactive communication and efficient issue resolution. The dashboard aims to demonstrate an understanding of this objective by highlighting repeat caller volumes across various markets and problem categories. By leveraging these insights, stakeholders can strategize to reduce call volumes, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize operational processes. Ultimately, the dashboard serves as a tool to empower the team in achieving these objectives effectively.
Key Dependencies:

The project relies on fictionalized datasets that are pre-anonymized and approved for use. It is crucial to ensure stakeholder access to all datasets for transparency and validation of the analysis steps taken. Primary contacts for data access and validation are Emma Santiago and Keith Portone. Successful execution of the project depends on seamless access to the datasets by stakeholders, facilitating their exploration of the analysis process and generated insights. This ensures alignment with project objectives of enhancing operational optimization and customer satisfaction through informed decision-making.
Stakeholder Requirements:

In order to continuously improve customer satisfaction, the dashboard must help Google Fiber decision-makers understand:

    How often customers are repeatedly calling.
    What problem types or other factors might be influencing those calls.

Required Features:

    A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date.
    A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type.
    Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter.
    Insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls.
    Exploration of repeat caller trends in the three different market cities.
    Design charts to allow stakeholders to view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.

Success Criteria:

    Specific: BI insights must delineate characteristics of repeat calls, including frequency and patterns of customer repetition.
    Measurable: Evaluation should include quantifiable metrics such as call frequency, volume, and distribution across different problem types and market cities.
    Action-oriented: Outcomes should quantify repeat caller numbers under various scenarios to provide actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction.
    Relevant: Metrics must align with the primary question: How frequently do customers repeatedly contact customer service?
    Time-bound: Analysis should cover a minimum one-year period to track changes in repeat caller behavior over time. Exploring data across multiple months will capture usage fluctuations and trends, aiding in informed decision-making for operational optimization.

User Journeys:

Enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by analyzing repeat caller patterns. User journeys will explore the customer experience, focusing on interactions leading to repeat calls. By mapping these journeys, stakeholders can identify pain points and areas for improvement. The goal is to understand why customers are repeatedly calling, whether due to unresolved issues or recurring problems. Insights from user journeys will inform strategies for proactive communication and targeted problem resolution, ultimately reducing call volumes and improving overall customer satisfaction.
Assumptions:

    The datasets contain columns indicating three different city service areas: market_1, market_2, and market_3.
    The dataset includes five problem types:
        Type_1: Account Management
        Type_2: Technician Troubleshooting
        Type_3: Scheduling
        Type_4: Construction
        Type_5: Internet and WiFi
    The dataset records repeat calls over seven-day periods, with the initial contact date listed as contacts_n. Subsequent call columns indicate the number of days since the first contact.

Compliance and Privacy:

The datasets are fictionalized versions of actual data and are already anonymized and approved. However, stakeholders need access to all datasets to explore the steps taken in the analysis.
Accessibility:

The dashboards should offer text alternatives, including large print and text-to-speech.
Roll-out Plan:

The stakeholders have requested a completed BI tool in six weeks.
